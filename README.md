**_This is the homepage for Renux OS_**.
### About
This project came as an idea from yours truly, a seasoned visual novel creator and enthusiast who loves watching anime. Now you too can do all of these things from an OS as soon as you install it!
_Based on Q4OS for maximum hardware compatibility_
### Installation
**1. On actual Hardware:**
Download the ISO file in Releases, and flash it onto a USB. Put the USB in the target machine, boot from it, and follow the instructions. Installation is the same as most other Linux Distributions.
**2: Virtual Machine:**
        _A: Windows:_
        Download the ISO file in Releases and download your virtual machine manager of choice. I use VMware Workstation Player. then Create a new virtual machine, using the Ubuntu x64 template, making sure to add at least 20 GB of free space to the virtual Hard Drive. Then Add the ISO to the Virtual Machine. You must have at least 1 gb ram to run this OS.
        _B: Linux:_
        Download the ISO file in Releases and download Qemu, KVM, or Virtualbox through the command line. Then Create a new virtual machine, using the Ubuntu x64 template, making sure to add at least 20 GB of free space to the virtual Hard Drive. Then Add the ISO to the Virtual Machine. You must have at least 1 gb ram to run this OS.
       _C: Mac:_
         Download the ISO file in Releases, and download your virtual machine manager of choice. Then Create a new virtual machine, using the Ubuntu x64 template, making sure to add at least 20 GB of free space to the virtual Hard Drive. Then Add the ISO to the Virtual Machine.
